I was testing a geolocation API in HTML5 on my Iphone5 and I needed to check how good is this API and started to working Geolocation.js. This library has one target - simplify the process of working with HTML5 API and Google Maps API for drawing the map with route.

The repository is public and is available here: [https://github.com/fedojo/geolocation](https://github.com/fedojo/geolocation)
