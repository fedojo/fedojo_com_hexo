Last week Ive started cooperation with [Geek Girls Carrot](http://geekgirlscarrots.pl/ "Geek Girls Carrots"). GGC is now working in few cities in Poland and gathers programming females. Today we had a first meeting in [Institute of Design in Kielce](http://www.idkielce.pl/en/ "Institute of Design in Kielce"). It was nice to be involved in so motivated team and to be a one of mentors. 

I would like to invite girls who want to learn what is HTML, CSS and JavaScript and how to use this languages to create a webpage. Workshops can be usefull as a introduction to webdevelopment for you! Full course is divided into twelve weekly meetings on which step by step we will be teaching web developments basic (and more advanced) techniques. One of the most important things is that workshops are totally free!

See you soon on workshops!
