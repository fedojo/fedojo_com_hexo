I was checkin my rss feed  and found really good post on [http://www.subtraction.com/](http://www.subtraction.com/ "http://www.subtraction.com/") about some new incoming software. Its tool for designers and FE developers. Created in this app mockup can be changed into HTML code without "overflowed" CSS/HTML code. What Im still waiting for is software in which I can choose a "grid" system. But its still a dream... :) Lets check blocks and its possibilities.
