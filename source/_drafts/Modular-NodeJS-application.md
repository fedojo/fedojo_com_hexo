After few applications created in Node.js / Express.js / MongoDB and FEWhateva Ive been a little bit confused when application was getting more complicated.
Scaling of code isn't simple when there is still new features coming and you want to maintain code correctly.

## From where we are coming from
The easiest way to deliver NodeJS/MongoDB app using Express.js is to make division into routes file, controllers / helpers / services folders.

## What is the goal
The goal is to create similar to Angular2(4/5) modularity which gathers functionalities of module in one place. It includes
needed models (Mongoose / Mongo), controllers, helpers, routes and tests.
