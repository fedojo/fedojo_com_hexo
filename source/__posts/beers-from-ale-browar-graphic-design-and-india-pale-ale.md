If you like to drink one beer in the evening you should taste a sip of Rowing Jack. More hardcore IPA is Crazy Mike. It has a IBU with one of highest levels which I ever drunk 100\. A few gulps can set you on feet with its aroma... But... What I like in this beers too are the pictures on labels :)

You need to try some of these beers (because it is hard to say everything about flavour and aroma) and check the website of [Ale Browar](http://www.alebrowar.pl/ "Ale Browar").
