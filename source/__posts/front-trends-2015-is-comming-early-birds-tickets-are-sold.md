Front Trends is the biggest Front End Conference in Poland. Ive been on this conference once and my thinking about FE changed and my motivation raised.

Previous week the registration started. Today I wanted to check availability of Early Birds Tickets and... all of them are sold. Congratulations to Front Trends promoteurs!
