Yeah... I know... You are FE Developer and you know what you learned last time. But... Do you know how to provide a lessons for younger guys who wants to involve into Front End? Yeah you will start your list "mate you need to know CSS, HTML, Javascript..." and here you will think and continue your list... "but in HTML and CSS you need to know how to create a good selector..." and now "but when you will learn HTML its good to use EMMET"... here I see your next thinking process "...and maybe JADE or HAML... maybe SLIM to speed up HTML build process"...

So... to gather this tools and skills I started a project on GitHub. Its now only a draft but I will try to add each day some new section. If you are a FEDev you can help me to make gather this in one doc. If you are begginer - you can start collecting skills with this doc. Do not hesitate to comment and be a contributor!
