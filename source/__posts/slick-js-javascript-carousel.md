Back in the days when I was a Flash Developer [Lee Brimelow ](http://www.leebrimelow.com/ "Lee Brimelow blog") on his [GotoAndLearn](http://gotoandlearn.com/ "GotoAndLearn") published interesting gallery type - carousel. I made my own carousel with him and customized a code - it was really beautiful. Till this time I was thinking about carousel like this in some JavaScript projects but have no time to make it. And on some project I needed some similar Carousel.

I use bxSlider in my projects but I think that it was time to try some new library. Research... Digging... and found!!! [Slick.js!](http://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/ "Slick.js")!! this is the library which I need!!!

Interesting option for me which bxSlider havent got is center mode. I needed a view simmilar to this one so slick.js now is one of my favorite libraries. You have to check it by yourself!
