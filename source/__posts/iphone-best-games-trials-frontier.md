I remember the times when I was playing wlastomania in the college. It was a special time into my life and during my long education so Im thinking about this game and and my smile looks like banana on my face.

Ive downloaded this game about two days ago but it took a lot of time from my private life (in breaks in Subway surf). Yes this is rather simple game but you need to involve uour brain snd fingers skills - you need to be focused. I falled in love with Tony Hawks Pro Skater on first Playstation so I love to make some tricks - this game have this feature too.

What this game is all about? Its about riding motorbike on weird routes and complete all missions. You have to try it by yourself:)
