Recruitment process is still getting better but when you are a specialist in some area you are still getting some emails/messages with new opportunities. Its in some cases looks like SPAM in your inbox. In some cases you this messages looks like template email with quick check of your availability and status what makes me nervous and blind for them. And here comes Workshape - with great idea:
> No Recruiters. No CVs.> 
> Just great opportunities, matched to you
Ive created an account today there. You can do it with GitHub so it is really simple. Than you have to prepare your own expectations (sallary, place of work, work mode) and list of your skills.

And here comes your profile:
